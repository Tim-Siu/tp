**User Stories**

1. **Must-Have User Story:**
    - As a **tutor**, I want to **view a list of PRs from my mentees** so that I can **efficiently review and provide feedback** without having to navigate through the GitHub Web interface.

2. **Nice-to-Have User Story:**
    - As a **manager**, I want to **view analytics on how tutors are dealing with mentee PRs** (e.g., average response time, number of PRs reviewed per tutor) so that I can **ensure the quality and consistency of the mentoring process**.

**NFRs (Non-Functional Requirements)**

1. **Performance/Scalability:** The PRT application should be able to handle the simultaneous tracking of up to 500 PRs without any noticeable lag in the user interface.

2. **Usability:** The PRT application's user interface should be intuitive enough that tutors and managers can start using the main features without any training, and the learning curve should be no longer than 30 minutes.

**Glossary**

1. **PR (Pull Request):** A method used by developers to submit their changes to a project. It contains the code modifications, the rationale behind them, and a request for these changes to be included in the main codebase.

**Software System:** PRT (Pull Request Tracker)

**Use Case:** UC03 - Add comments to mentee PRs

**Actors:** Tutor

**MSS:**

1. Tutor logs into the PRT system.
2. PRT displays the list of PRs from mentees.
3. Tutor invokes <ins>UC1. Sort PRs by a criterion and selects to sort by PR size</ins>.

5. Tutor selects the first PR from the list for review.
6. Tutor reads the changes in the PR.

8. Tutor invokes <ins>UC2. Add comments to a PR</ins>.
9. Tutor types in the feedback/comments for the PR.
10. Tutor submits the comments.
11. PRT updates the PR with the tutor's comments.
12. PRT sends a notification to the mentee about the new comment.
13. Steps 5-12 are repeated for each PR in the list until the Tutor completes commenting on all selected PRs.

**Use case ends.**
